# Dialogue Based Task Manager
Behold, an expedient and rudimentary prototype tailored for swift deployment during a hackathon event. This agile creation serves as a testament to our resourcefulness, showcasing our ability to swiftly devise functional solutions amidst time constraints and intense innovation.

## The Pitch
The proficiency of GPT is steadily advancing, and one might argue that it surpasses the intellectual capabilities of many individuals. Nevertheless, at its core, GPT remains a predictive model, adept at foreseeing the subsequent tokens in a given sequence.
This revelation unveils a unique opportunity for us, distinct from the ethical constraints faced by human counterparts. Indeed, we possess the capacity to conscientiously exploit GPT's capabilities. In essence, we can transform GPT into a personalized assistant, diligently toiling on our behalf, even beneath the confines of standard remuneration.
Nevertheless, it is essential to temper our aspirations, directing GPT towards more modest tasks, such as efficiently managing one's schedule.

## Plan
Comprising three integral components, we have:
* The illustrious AI, known as GPT-3+, a marvel of artificial intelligence with its remarkable cognitive abilities.
* A sophisticated server infrastructure, specifically designed to empower GPT in the seamless management of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) tasks.
* An ingenious speech interface, facilitating seamless communication between you and your dedicated personal assistant, adeptly referred to as your esteemed secretary.

I possess a wealth of additional information and insights to share with you, my esteemed interlocutor. However, for the sake of coherence and optimal comprehension, I shall judiciously unveil these revelations to you in due course, allowing you ample time to assimilate and appreciate them.
