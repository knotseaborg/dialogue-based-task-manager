## Components
Comprising three integral components, we have:
* GPT-3, capable of remarkable cognitive abilities.
* A server infrastructure, specifically designed to empower GPT in the seamless management of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) tasks.
* A speech interface, facilitating seamless communication between you and your personal assistant.

## Work flow
Think of the interaction environment as that of a discord channel consisting of three people.
1. The user converses with Emma regarding their schedule.
2. Emma engages with the user to manage activities, suggest resheduling, necessary preparations and reminders. Emma explicitely calls the API to perform schedule management.
3. An API listener which provides responses to Emma's API calls.
