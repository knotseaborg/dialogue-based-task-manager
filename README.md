# Dialogue Based Task Manager
The proficiency of GPT is steadily advancing, and one might argue that it surpasses the intellectual capabilities of many individuals. Nevertheless, at its core, GPT remains a predictive model, adept at foreseeing the subsequent tokens in a given sequence.
This revelation unveils a unique opportunity for us, distinct from the ethical constraints faced by human counterparts. Indeed, we possess the capacity to conscientiously exploit GPT's capabilities. In essence, we can transform GPT into a personalized assistant, diligently toiling on our behalf, even beneath the confines of standard remuneration.
Nevertheless, it is essential to temper our aspirations, directing GPT towards more modest tasks, such as efficiently managing one's schedule.
